### Fork Note:  This uses some minor modifications of my own combined with the work of Tommy-Carlos Williams and ThalesValentim to return the absolute path of the image in IOS, with a semi-unique filename.  Usage remains the same.  Essentially, it has been brought inline with the android version.

Canvas2ImagePlugin
============

This plugin allows you to save the contents of an HTML canvas tag to the iOS Photo Library, Android Gallery or WindowsPhone 8 Photo Album from your app.

See an example project using it here: [https://github.com/devgeeks/Canvas2ImageDemo](https://github.com/devgeeks/Canvas2ImageDemo) - note: this app does not work in wp8.

Installation
------------

### For Cordova 3.0.x:

1. To add this plugin just type: `cordova plugin add https://github.com/wbt11a/Canvas2ImagePlugin.git` or `phonegap local plugin add https://github.com/wbt11a/Canvas2ImagePlugin.git`
2. To remove this plugin type: `cordova plugin remove org.wbt11a.Canvas2ImagePlugin` or `phonegap local plugin remove org.wbt11a.Canvas2ImagePlugin`

### NOTE: For older versions of Cordova (You will probably have to use tag 0.2.0)


Usage:
------

Call the `window.canvas2ImagePlugin.saveImageDataToLibrary()` method using success and error callbacks and the id attribute or the element object of the canvas to save:

### Example
```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="165px" height="145px"></canvas>
```

```javascript
function onDeviceReady()
{
	window.canvas2ImagePlugin.saveImageDataToLibrary(
        function(msg){
            console.log(msg);  //msg is the filename path (for android and iOS)
        },
        function(err){
            console.log(err);
        },
        document.getElementById('myCanvas')
    );
}
```
