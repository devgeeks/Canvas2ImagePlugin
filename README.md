Canvas2ImagePlugin
============

### NOTE: This plugin is NOT being actively maintained. I would love someone with a decent fork of it to take it over. Contact me if you are interested.

This plugin allows you to save the contents of an HTML canvas tag to the iOS Photo Library, Android Gallery or WindowsPhone 8 Photo Album from your app.

See an example project using it here: [https://github.com/devgeeks/Canvas2ImageDemo](https://github.com/devgeeks/Canvas2ImageDemo) - note: this app does not work in wp8.

Installation
------------

### For Cordova 3.0.x:

1. To add this plugin just type: `cordova plugin add https://github.com/devgeeks/Canvas2ImagePlugin.git` or `phonegap local plugin add https://github.com/devgeeks/Canvas2ImagePlugin.git`
2. To remove this plugin type: `cordova plugin remove org.devgeeks.Canvas2ImagePlugin` or `phonegap local plugin remove org.devgeeks.Canvas2ImagePlugin`

### NOTE: For older versions of Cordova (You will probably have to use tag 0.2.0)

Usage:
------

Call the `window.canvas2ImagePlugin.saveImageDataToLibrary()` method using success and error callbacks and the id attribute or the element object of the canvas to save:

### Example
```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="165px" height="145px"></canvas>
```

```javascript
function onDeviceReady()
{
	window.canvas2ImagePlugin.saveImageDataToLibrary(
        function(msg){
            console.log(msg);
        },
        function(err){
            console.log(err);
        },
        document.getElementById('myCanvas')
    );
}
```
